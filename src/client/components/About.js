        About Us Text Examples are all over the Internet (thank you Google), but
        few go into why it’s a good design beyond just the copy. Here’s the
        thing about copy, it’s only good if someone reads it. Likewise, a
        professional design only creates a successful About Us page, if it
        showcases good content. In this video I discuss 3 websites that are
        handling their about me pages correctly. And just for kicks, I threw in
        one very prominent website that, well, isn’t. Today, you’ll learn why
        it’s important that your About Us page be laid out like a landing page.
        Also we’ll talk about why items like the Backstory, Charity focuses,
        etc, need to be linked out to their own pages.
